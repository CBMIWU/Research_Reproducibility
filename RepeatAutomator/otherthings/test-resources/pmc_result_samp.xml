          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>The advent of universal health care coverage in the United States and the use of electronic health records can make the medical record a disease surveillance tool. The objective of our study was to identify criteria that accurately categorize acute coronary and heart failure events by using electronic health record data exclusively so that the medical record can be used for surveillance without manual record review.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>We serially compared 3 computer algorithms to manual record review. The first 2 algorithms relied on ICD-9-CM (<italic>International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification</italic>) codes, troponin levels, electrocardiogram (ECG) data, and echocardiograph data. The third algorithm relied on a detailed coding system, Intelligent Medical Objects, Inc., (IMO) interface terminology, troponin levels, and echocardiograph data.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; for the initial algorithm was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41&#x2013;0.54). Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.55&#x2013;0.68) for the second algorithm. Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; for the third algorithm was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98&#x2013;1.00).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p>Electronic medical record data are sufficient to categorize coronary heart disease and heart failure events without manual record review. However, only moderate agreement with medical record review can be achieved when the classification is based on 4-digit ICD-9-CM codes because ICD-9-CM 410.9 includes myocardial infarction with elevation of the ST segment on ECG (STEMI) and myocardial infarction without elevation of the ST segment on ECG (nSTEMI). Nearly perfect agreement can be achieved using IMO interface terminology, a more detailed coding system that tracks to ICD9, ICD10 (<italic>International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification</italic>), and SnoMED-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine &#x2013; Clinical Terms).</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Surveillance to track the incidence, prevalence, and treatment of disease is a basic function of public health. Medical records can be used as surveillance tools, and the expense of manual record review could be avoided if medical records were representative of populations and if data in the medical record were standardized. Because the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will provide universal health care coverage for Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>), medical records could become a continuous population census. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and other authorities give the US Department of Health and Human Services the authority to promote electronic health records that permit electronic exchange of health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). Electronic information exchange could enable creation of a standardized data set for use in public health surveillance. The cataloging of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease surveys by an Institute of Medicine committee did not identify any algorithms that would enable use of the medical record to assess opportunities to improve outcomes across the broad spectrum of heart disease prevention and heart disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>). Nevertheless, the committee did recognize that electronic health records may be an emerging source of disease surveillance data and recommended that surveillance systems be designed so that they contribute to improved patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p>
      <p>We are developing a decision-support tool that will identify opportunities for preventing heart disease and for improving outcomes for patients with heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>). The first step in using the decision support tool is to classify each event by using an algorithm. In an attempt to eliminate the need for manual review of the medical record, we tested whether an electronic medical record of a medical group contained the data necessary to create an algorithm that could accurately categorize acute coronary heart disease and heart failure events.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec sec-type="methods">
      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>The first iteration of the computer algorithm was approved on November 20, 2008, by the HealthPartners Research Foundation Institutional Review Board as protocol no. 08&#x2013;093, and the next 2 iterations were approved on September 21, 2009, as part of protocol no. 09&#x2013;023. We completed the analysis on February 29, 2012.</p>
      <sec>
        <title>Manual record review criteria</title>
        <p>The algorithm classifies coronary heart disease and heart failure events into 6 types: 1) acute myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation (STEMI) on electrocardiogram (ECG), 2) acute heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction at or below 35% (systolic heart failure), 3) acute myocardial infarction without ST segment elevation (nSTEMI) on ECG, 4) unstable angina or other acute ischemic event (unstable angina), 5) incident diagnosis made in the ambulatory setting (ambulatory presentation), and 6) chronic prevalent disease without an acute event during the period of interest (chronic disease). The classification system is hierarchical: a patient with a STEMI complicated by acute heart failure would be classified as having a STEMI. Likewise, a patient with acute heart failure, elevated levels of troponin (a protein that is present in blood during acute myocardial infarction), and an ECG that did not show a STEMI would be classified as having acute heart failure. The diagnoses are presented in hierarchical order in the first column of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref>.</p>

        <title>First iteration</title>
        <p>For the first iteration of the computer algorithm we used medical record data from 254 HealthPartners Medical Group (HPMG) patients who were also insured by HealthPartners. These patients were aged 40 to 74 years and had been treated for coronary heart disease or systolic heart failure from August 8, 2007, through July 31, 2008. August 8 was chosen as the start date because that was the day that the hospital ECG data file and the outpatient ECG data file were combined into a single file. To be included, patients needed to be HPMG patients so that we had access to their clinical records, and they needed to be insured by HealthPartners so that we had access to the ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes associated with their claims data. We used the computer algorithm to select patient records of coronary heart disease and heart failure events from each of the 6 categories. Each of the records was randomly assigned to a cardiologist (T.E.K. or C.J.B.) for manual record review, and 48 records were reviewed by both cardiologists. The cardiologists agreed on the diagnosis for 47 of the 48 patients. We sampled patient records until we had at least 30 verified cases of coronary heart disease and heart failure in each diagnostic category or had exhausted potential records for analysis. This process resulted in more than 30 cases identified as fitting some of the 6 diagnostic categories. The initial computer algorithm is presented in column 3 of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref>. We used SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) to calculate Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; for all events combined and revised the computer algorithm in response to post hoc analyses of the discordant cases.</p>
        <p>After an ECG is interpreted by a physician, the text interpretation is converted to numerical codes and stored in an electronic database. During the first iteration, it was not possible to search the database for ECGs that had codes consistent with a STEMI. Software that supported search for codes became available when we were working on the second iteration, so we added ECG computer codes to the algorithms for STEMIs and nSTEMIs. As described in column 4 of the Table, we added ICD-9-CM 786.5 to the screening codes for unstable angina and excluded patients who had been admitted for pacemaker or defibrillator placement or revision. For the diagnosis of ambulatory presentation we required that the first insurance claim for heart disease was from an office visit, that there were no prior insurance claims for heart disease, and that there were 2 or more years of observations in the medical record. For chronic prevalent disease we required 2 or more years of observation with heart disease diagnosed before the period of interest and no hospitalization for heart disease or chest pain during the period of interest.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Second iteration</title>
        <p>We analyzed 245 cases to test the second iteration of the computer algorithm. We based the second iteration on data from HPMG patients who were also insured by HealthPartners and were treated by HPMG from January 1 through December 31, 2010. We used the second iteration to draw random samples for each diagnostic category, and 2 nurses and a physician reviewed the medical records. As with the first iteration, we calculated Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; and revised the computer algorithm in response to post hoc analysis of the discordant cases.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec>
        <title>Third iteration</title>
        <p>We analyzed 184 records for the third algorithm, 50 each for STEMI, nSTEMI, and chronic prevalent disease and 34 for acute heart failure with a depressed ejection fraction. We did not require HPMG patients to be insured by HealthPartners for the third iteration, because we did not need claims data to identify ICD-9-CM codes. However, 87% of the patients in the sampling frame had been insured by HealthPartners at some time, and 57% were insured by HealthPartners in 2010. As with the second iteration, the sampling time frame was from January 1 through December 31, 2010. We modified the computer algorithm for the third iteration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table)</xref> with 3 major changes. First, we used Intelligent Medical Objects, Inc, interface terminology (IMO terms) to distinguish between STEMI and nSTEMI. IMO terms are codes that are based on ICD-9-CM codes but have specificity added with a fifth numerical digit and 1 or more letters following the numerals. For example, in addition to IMO terms 410.0&#x2013;410.6 and 410.8 that are specific for STEMI, there are eleven 410.9 IMO terms that are specific for STEMI. In addition to 410.7, which is specific for nSTEMI there are at least 10 additional IMO terms that identify nSTEMI. IMO terms map to ICD-9-CM, ICD-10, and SnoMED-CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>). Epic (Epic, Verona, Wisconsin), Cerner (Cerner Corporation, North Kansas City, Missouri), NextGen (NextGen Healthcare, Horsham, Pennsylvania), and several other electronic medical record systems incorporate IMO terms in their software. Epic stores these statements in the medical record.</p>
        <p>We made the second modification, eliminating the category of unstable angina, because we found that most patients in this category already have a diagnosis of coronary heart disease. Because there is no compelling evidence that a patient hospitalized for chest pain with normal troponin levels benefits from an angiogram or therapies other than risk factor control, all gaps in their care would be detected during the analysis of patients with chronic disease.</p>
        <p>We made the third modification, combining ambulatory presentation and chronic disease into a single category, because pursuit of therapies other than symptom control, daily aspirin, and risk factor control for a patient who has coronary heart disease diagnosed in the ambulatory setting is optional and based on the results of further diagnostic testing.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We compared the classification by the computer algorithm to manual record review in 254 patients in the first iteration. After we developed the computer algorithm for the first iteration, we learned that ECG analysis software used by HPMG at that time did not permit searching for abnormalities across patients. Thus, we could not distinguish between STEMIs and nSTEMIs without manual review of the ECGs. However, when we grouped STEMIs and nSTEMIs together, we achieved 94% (60/64) agreement between the computer algorithm and manual review of the cases that were identified as myocardial infarction by the computer algorithm. Agreement in the other categories ranged from 38% for ambulatory presentation to 52% for systolic heart failure; 46 of the cases selected by the computer algorithm did not fit any of the 6 categories by manual record review. Overall agreement on the first iteration was 57% (Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA;, 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41&#x2013;0.54) when STEMIs and nSTEMIs were considered as a single category (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref>).</p>
      <p>We compared classification with the computer algorithm to manual review in 245 patient records for the second iteration. Agreement was 67% (16/24) for STEMI diagnoses and 100% (21/21) for heart failure diagnoses. Agreement for nSTEMI diagnoses was 78% (39/50) and 38% (19/50) for unstable angina. Agreement was 46% (23/50) for ambulatory presentation and 90% (45/50) for chronic disease diagnoses. Overall agreement was 67% (163/245), and Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.55&#x2013;0.68) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table</xref>).</p>
      <p>We compared classification with the computer algorithm to manual review in 184 cases for the third iteration. The only disagreement was a single patient diagnosis identified as an nSTEMI by the computer algorithm and systolic heart failure by the reviewers. Overall agreement was greater than 99%, and Cohen&#x2019;s &#x3BA; was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98&#x2013;1.00).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>By using an algorithm that processes only electronic data from the medical records of patients treated for coronary heart disease or heart failure, we were able to replicate the clinician&#x2019;s diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy. To distinguish between STEMI and nSTEMI, the algorithm uses highly specific diagnostic statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>) that map to ICD-9-CM, ICD-10, SnoMED CT, and Unified Medical Language System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>). Four-digit ICD-9-CM codes are not detailed enough to make the distinction, because the code 410.9 can represent both STEMI and nSTEMI.</p>
      <p>Our study has limitations. The analysis is based on the records of only 1 medical group; other groups may have a different experience, so algorithm performance should be tested before adoption for routine use. The purpose of this study is to determine the best algorithm with which to estimate the number and type of acute events in a population. If the purpose were to identify patients for case management or to possibly change treatment strategies, a final step of manual record review might be indicated.</p>
      <p>It appears unlikely that electronic data can be used to distinguish unstable angina pectoris from symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea that are not due to ischemic heart disease. However, we believe that this is not an important task. Given the sensitivity of troponin assays to detect ischemia and the fact that many of the patients who have normal troponin levels while hospitalized with chest pain or dyspnea are already known to have heart disease, it is probably not necessary to identify this class of patients. There is no compelling evidence that angioplasty reduces mortality in patients who have normal troponin levels in association with their chest pain. Proceeding to angiography would still be an option, but in this case angioplasty would be for symptom control, not mortality reduction.</p>
      <p>The use of the ECG database to classify patients may deserve further attention. Only 3 of the 16 diagnoses that manual record review confirmed as STEMIs in the second iteration had codes in the ECG database that indicated ST elevation. Conversely, most of the ECGs with ST elevation codes were not associated with acute myocardial infarction. Using a combination of codes that indicates ST elevation followed by the appearance of Q-wave codes may be more fruitful, but if rescue angioplasty prevents the development of Q-waves, even this strategy would not detect STEMIs.</p>
      <p>Our effort to classify events without manual record review is not unique. Natural language processing has been used to assess quality of care for acute myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>), and the eMERGE (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics) Network is promoting the sharing of case identification algorithms, mainly for genomics research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>). A systems dynamics simulation program developed by several organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can be used to estimate the effect of preventive interventions, but it cannot compare the effect of preventive interventions with treatments of acute events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>).</p>
      <p>It may not seem appropriate to accept the clinical diagnosis as the gold standard for acute myocardial infarction. Ideally, criteria would be based entirely on objective evidence. However, several points must be acknowledged. First, our goal with the project is to develop a method by which the clinician&#x2019;s diagnosis can be identified from electronic media with the granularity that is necessary to assess whether the patient received all of the evidence-based care that was indicated. We have shown that this is possible. Whether the clinician made the correct diagnosis is a different question. Second, all criteria depend to some extent on diagnostic coding, interpretation of laboratory data collected, and subjective interpretation of patient symptoms. Third, the development of a universal definition of myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>) means that, at least for centers where cardiologists practice, there is agreement about the meaning behind the diagnostic codes that are being assigned to patients&#x2019; events.</p>
      <p>In 2007 the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement outlining the essential features of a surveillance system that would support the prevention and management of heart disease and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>). Among other components, the statement called for the design and conduct of nationally representative surveillance programs that oversample ethnic subgroups and certain counties. The statement also declared that mechanisms should be developed to enable linkage between health care data systems, national surveillance programs, and electronic health records. The authors of the report acknowledged that the cost of these endeavors would be barriers to implementation. However, the changing health care landscape could markedly reduce the cost of these programs. If universal coverage is implemented and other electronic health record systems also have the capability to identify heart disease prevalence and gaps in evidence-based care, an opportunity to use the electronic health record as a public health surveillance tool at minimal cost will have been created.</p>

        <sec id="S1">
          <title>Study objective</title>
          <p id="P1">Little is known about the transient and sustained operational effects of electronic health records on emergency department (ED) performance. We quantify how the implementation of a comprehensive electronic health record was associated with metrics of operational performance, test ordering, and medication administration at a single-center ED.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S2">
          <title>Methods</title>
          <p id="P2">We performed a longitudinal analysis of electronic data from a single, suburban, academic ED during 28 weeks between May 2011 and November 2011. We assessed length of stay, use of diagnostic testing, medication administration, radiologic imaging, and patient satisfaction during a 4-week baseline measurement period and then tracked changes in these variables during the 24 weeks after implementation of the electronic health record.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S3">
          <title>Results</title>
          <p id="P3">Median length of stay increased and patient satisfaction was reduced transiently, returning to baseline after 4 to 8 weeks. Rates of laboratory testing, medication administration, overall radiologic imaging, radiographs, computed tomography scans, and ECG ordering all showed sustained increases throughout the 24 weeks after electronic health record implementation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="S4">
          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <p id="P4">Electronic health record implementation in this single-center study was associated with both transient and sustained changes in metrics of ED performance, as well as laboratory and medication ordering. Understanding ways in which an ED can be affected by electronic health record implementation is critical to providing insight about ways to mitigate transient disruption and to maximize potential benefits of the technology.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Many projects on developing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems have been carried out in many countries. The current study was conducted to review the published data on the utilization of open source EHR systems in different countries all over the world. Using free text and keyword search techniques, six bibliographic databases were searched for related articles. The identified papers were screened and reviewed during a string of stages for the irrelevancy and validity. The findings showed that open source EHRs have been wildly used by source limited regions in all continents, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. It would create opportunities to improve national healthcare level especially in developing countries with minimal financial resources. Open source technology is a solution to overcome the problems of high-costs and inflexibility associated with the proprietary health information systems.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Today with the vast development of technology in the world responding to the variable and complex needs for interchanging clinical information among health-care providers to improve the quality of health-care services seems more practical than any time before. Efficacy of healthcare services and medical interventions are highly dependent on a trust worthy and integrated history of individual medical and health status. Electronic health record (EHR) is one such response that covers the need of all engaged parties including patients, doctors, clinical staff, insurance companies, health care providers and policy makers. It provides a platform on which individual health information is stored and accessed only by authorized people. EHR is defined as digitally stored health-care information about an individual's life with the purpose of supporting continuity of care, education and research. Lack of the required health information causes a lot of delay and expenses in health-care delivery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] EHR is a new way of storing and processing health information. A wide range of terms and phrases have been used to describe health and medical records. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines EHR as &#x201C;an electronic record of health-related information on an individual that is created, gathered, managed and consulted by authorized health-care clinicians and staff.&#x201D;[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The terms &#x201C;Electronic Medical Record,&#x201D; (EMR) Computer-based Patient Record (CPR), Electronic Patient Record (EPR), Personal Health Record (PHR), Computerized Medical Record (CMR) may also be treated synonymously with EHR.</p>

      <title>OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (OSS)</title>
      <p>In terms of software development and licensing, OSS and proprietary software are two main categories of software.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] &#x201C;The promise of opensource is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.&#x201D;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] OSS encourages having access to the source code &#x2014; the code computer programmers write-with the freedom of usage, modification and redistribution. On the contrary, he source code in proprietary software is confidential. The end user of such products can access and execute only the machine code.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The source code of proprietary software is closed and belongs only to the developer. The intention of developing this kind of software is to make a profit from licensing, rental or sale of the software and maintain full control of the product.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p>
      <p>Although OSS and &#x201C;free software&#x201D; describe almost the same category of software, they stand for views based on different values. Free software respects freedom to run the software to study and change it and also to redistribute copies with or without changes. The free software movement begins in 1983. In 1984, the free operating system GNU was developed.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free, copy left license for software, which is intended to guarantee the freedom to share and change all versions of software to make sure it remains free for all its users.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] As some of the users and developers of free software were not agreed with the goals of the free software movement, a part of the free software community separated in 1998 and began to campaign in the name of &#x201C;open source&#x201D; afterward. Open source is based only on practical values, such as making or having powerful and reliable software.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Open Source Software (OSS), Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Free, Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS)- although are not exactly the same- are alternative terms for free software.</p>
      <p>In the health sector, open source products have been designed to improve health-care while reducing the cost of similar proprietary products. According to Reynolds and Wyatt, it creates &#x201C;a key opportunity for the promotion of effective systems by enhancing clinical engagement in software development, fostering innovation, improving system usability and reducing costs and should therefore be central to a rational HIS [Healthcare Information System] procurement strategy.&#x201D;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A handful of projects on developing EHR systems have been carried out in many countries.</p>
      <sec id="sec2-1">
        <title>EHR in USA</title>
        <p>In the United States of America, approximately 23.9% of physicians used EHR in the ambulatory setting and only 5%of hospitals used Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) through 2005.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A study on the levels of EHR adoption in USA revealed that only few US hospitals had a comprehensive electronic clinical information system and many others only had parts of an electronic records system. It seems that financial support, interoperability and training of information technology support staff by policy makers is necessary for increasing the application of EHR in US hospitals.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Since the late 1970s, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a governmental sector advanced their efforts to develop an extensive organizational health information system named veterans&#x2019; health information systems and technology architecture (VistA). VistA uses Massachusetts general hospital utility multi-programming system (MUMPS) a program that can be used for disease case registries.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Only a few major organizations in the private sector worked on the implementation of EHRs in USA.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p>

        <title>EHR in Canada</title>
        <p>Canada is another country, which seeks technological solutions to expand high quality health-care services across the country. These solutions also create new challenges, especially in acceptable standards, choice of technologies, overcoming traditional jurisdictional boundaries, privacy and confidentiality.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Many projects were planned to develop an efficient EHR in Canada. Health Infoway is among such efforts. Canada Health Infoway is a non-profit corporation founded by the federal government of Canadian 2000. The initial aim of this organization was to accelerate the development of EHR on a pan-Canadian basis by 2007. It tries to connect organizations, which are working on EHR projects and encourage them to produce and share &#x201C;knowledge objects,&#x201D; which can be reused by other organizations. Canada Health Infoway is a major investment for Canadians with 1.1 billion dollar budget.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This would support more efficient health-care delivery, patient confidentiality, immediate access to complete and accurate patient information while enabling better decisions about diagnosis and treatment. The final result would be a sustainable health-care system with higher quality, accessibility, productivity and cost savings.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p>

        <title>EHR in England</title>
        <p>In England, National Program for Information Technology, which is directed by the National Health Service (NHS) is responsible for delivering England's EHR.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] NHS established an EHR system in 2005. The aim was to provide all 50 million NHS patients with an individual electronic NHS Care Record Service (NHSCRS) by 2010. The NHSCRS would securely share the detailed records of each person between different parts of the local NHS sites. The system uses a unique identifier for each patient. Patients would be able to have a summary of their important health information, known as their Summary Care Record (SCR), available to authorized NHS staff anywhere in the NHS in England. They also would access their SCR using a secure website named as &#x201C;HealthSpace.&#x201D; The budget of this project was estimated 12.6 billion Pounds in 2006. This was almost 2 times more than what was estimated since the project was first launched. It was assumed that the project may finally cost more than 20 billion pounds.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p>

        <title>EHR in Australia</title>
        <p>Many regional and national EHR projects and systems have been developed in the Asia-Pacific region.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In Australia as the pioneer of EHRs, Health Information Technology (HIT) is considered the basis for improving the quality of healthcare, safety and efficiency by the government. General practices were encouraged to install clinical software packages for prescribing and transmission of clinical data in the late 1990s.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] HealthConnect is a joint Australian, State and Territory Governments&#x2019; initiative for revolving paper-based health records to EHRs for the benefit of consumers and also health-care providers. Through which, health information would be more quickly available and transferred among healthcare professionals under more secure condition. The main aims of this program was the accessibility of life-saving information in emergencies and also the improvement of safety and quality of health information through a shared electronic health record (SEHR).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA) is responsible for developing a design for SEHR. NEHTA was funded jointly by the Australian, state and territory governments in 2005 to develop national standards and infrastructure for EHR across Australia.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p>

        <p>Primary selection of studies was based on the inclusion criteria, which were original and review articles, short communications, case reports and scientific letters on the utilization of open source EHR in any country. The duplicated publications were excluded. At the first screening stage, two reviewers (FA andFS) independently screened title and abstract of retrieved documents to determine those which met the eligibility criteria. Full citations of those documents considered eligible at least by one reviewer were imported into an EndNote database. In the next stage, the full text of the imported papers were provided and reviewed for subject relevancy individually by each of the two reviewers. A critical appraisal check list was used to evaluate the validity of the selected studies and to criticize them.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Finally, the two reviewers made a face-to-face meeting, discussing on papers selections. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. In the cases, which consensus did not happen, a third reviewer (MA) made the final decision on the eligibility of a particular paper. Consequently, those papers, which have been considered as valid by both reviewers, selected for data extraction.</p>

        <p>PING is a free and open source health information system. It is designed and implemented as an interoperable, personally controlled health record, which enables patients to have control accessibility to their medical information by others. PING architecture is based on replaceable modular pieces so that collaborators can add to or substitute in PING components. PING compiles lifelong patient history and allows patients to store encrypted copies of their records in selective storage sites. PING is adopted by the Canadian National Research as a model for regional, provincial and national personally controlled health records.</p>

        <title>PropeRWeb</title>
        <p>PropeRWeb is a multidisciplinary EHR system, which is built based on open standards in Netherlands. As a web based application, the system uses servlets and Java Server Pages with CORBA connection to the database servers. In PropeRWeb, patients and care givers are separated into two different Person Identification Specification (PIDS) servers to enhance security and privacy. Auditing as a functionality that provides info at a specific moment is implemented in PropeRWeb by distinguishing between versions of archetypes and forms. Although some aspects such as user friendliness need more improvements; however, the system is flexible enough to be readily customized for use in a variety of clinical domains.</p>

        <title>WorldVistA</title>
        <p>WorldVistA is an open source EHR system that evolved from VistA project to make it widely available outside of its original setting within the United States and around the world. The system developed additional modules such as pediatrics, obstetrics and patient billing not normally used in the veteran's health-care setting. WorldVistA is able to run on proprietary intersystem cache database. Web-based and client-server configurations can be established on the system depending on the environment. Although it is a primary care system, but other templates for specialties can be created by users. WorldVistA has various functionalities including patient registration, drug allergy and interaction checking, creating health maintenance remainders, clinical order entry, templates for obstetrics/gynecology and pediatrics care, viewing lab and imaging results and generating reports of demographics, medications and problems.</p>

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>EHR provides brilliant chance of readily retrieving the required information for conducting a faster and a much more accurate decision for action. Decline in medical errors is another important advantage of applying EHR that should seriously be taken into account.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Open source EHRs have been designed to improve health-care while reducing the cost of similar proprietary systems. Those who developed OSS actually encourage it and rely on this philosophy to see the software spread and grow beyond its original creators.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] According to the findings, open source EHR systems have been wildly welcomed by source limited regions around the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Argentina, Australia, Chile, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Germany, Ghana, Haiti, Jordan, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Mozambique, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sweden, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, USA and Zimbabwe are among countries, which used open source EHRs to enhance the health care quality. The results indicated that many countries especially developing countries- demand to use an interoperable and cost-efficient EHR system, which is flexible enough to modify and improve.</p>
      <p>Commercial software companies and some people claim that open source systems cannot fulfil medicolegal and security requirements required for a health-care system and may allow hackers to know the software bugs more easily than proprietary software.[<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] However, some experts believe that open source systems are more secure from external attack than closed source systems because the independent assessment of system security, which happens in OSS &#x201C;makes bug patching easier and more likely and forces developers to spend more effort on the quality of their code.&#x201D;[<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] Active assessment of software codes by their users makes them more stable than proprietary systems. On the other hand, because of commercial pressures customers&#x2019; requirements are more important for proprietary software developers than security requirements, which are invisible to customers.[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</p>
      <p>Open source systems make opportunities for advanced innovation in the health information sector of low income countries.[<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] However, cost- efficiency seems to be the most important reason for utilization of open source systems in many countries. Despite the enormous financial investment to Canada Health Infoway, some believes that the reduction in duplicated efforts will reduce the total expenses of a pan-Canadian EHR.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Some critics said that spending billions of dollars in purchasing health software would lead to enormous overpayments to technology companies and consultants. Such a huge investment on a national health information structure encourages a competition between companies for profitable deals to sell their electronic health systems promising to connect patients, doctors and hospitals. They believe that OSS would be a better solution instead of spending too much money on expensive proprietary products.[<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] The open three (O3) consortium project launched in 2004 is an example of utilization of OSS, which was based on the agreements on the impact of open solutions in facilitating fast integration of health systems in Europe and the world.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Even, in the USA some of the current EHR systems are not fully desirable because of being expensive and inflexible and proprietary. Open source systems with the potentiality for local customization could be a possible solution to solve these problems and to improve health-care services in the United States as they have done in many other countries around the world.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] The evidences indicated that utilization of OSS in the health sector is more welcomed in developing countries with financial limitations. Although various open source EHR programs may not fully encompass the functionality requirements for an ideal EHR system, they create opportunities to improve national health-care level in countries with minimal financial resources.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Developing countries use open source EHRs to lower cost and to improve the efficiency and quality of health-care services. The overall results indicated that open source EHR is a solution to overcome the problems of high costs and inflexibility associated with proprietary systems.</p>

      <abstract>
        <sec>
          <title>Purpose:</title>
          <p>To evaluate three measures related to electronic health record (EHR) implementation: clinical volume, time requirements, and nature of clinical documentation. Comparison is made to baseline paper documentation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods:</title>
          <p>An academic ophthalmology department implemented an EHR in 2006. A study population was defined of faculty providers who worked the 5 months before and after implementation. Clinical volumes, as well as time length for each patient encounter, were collected from the EHR reporting system. To directly compare time requirements, two faculty providers who utilized both paper and EHR systems completed time-motion logs to record the number of patients, clinic time, and nonclinic time to complete documentation. Faculty providers and databases were queried to identify patient records containing both paper and EHR notes, from which three cases were identified to illustrate representative documentation differences.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results:</title>
          <p>Twenty-three faculty providers completed 120,490 clinical encounters during a 3-year study period. Compared to baseline clinical volume from 3 months pre-implementation, the post-implementation volume was 88% in quarter 1, 93% in year 1, 97% in year 2, and 97% in year 3. Among all encounters, 75% were completed within 1.7 days after beginning documentation. The mean total time per patient was 6.8 minutes longer with EHR than paper (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.01). EHR documentation involved greater reliance on textual interpretation of clinical findings, whereas paper notes used more graphical representations, and EHR notes were longer and included automatically generated text.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Conclusion:</title>
          <p>This EHR implementation was associated with increased documentation time, little or no increase in clinical volume, and changes in the nature of ophthalmic documentation.</p>
