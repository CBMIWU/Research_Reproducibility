## Research Reproducibility

###Overview
Working in collaboration between the Center for Biomedical Informatics and the Washington University library, we aim to improve research through: 

Aim 1: Understand WU ICTS current practices for facilitating reproducible biomedical research. This was completed by conducting literature reviews of current practices and recommendations, as well as interviews with domain researchers. The manuscripts used: https://www.zotero.org/groups/biomedical_informatics_resrepro  

Aim 2: Create a practical workflow model enabling best practices to be incorporated into biomedical reproducible research.  In conjunction with the general best practices for reproducible research, the data gathered from interviews with researchers (Aim 1) will be analyzed, and a model for biomedical reproducible research will be developed.
